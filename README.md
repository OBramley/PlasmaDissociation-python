# Plasma Dissociation Code

## Description

[Add a brief description of your project here]

## Installation

[Python package requirements
    numpy -- pip install pyinstaller
    scipy -- pip install scipy
    subrprocess
    re 
    math
    sys
    socket
    json
    shutil
    pyinstaller -- pip install pyinstaller
    chemformula -- pip install chemformula 
    pyqchem -- pip install pyqchem 

Note that when I installed pyqchem the tools folder of packages did not install correctly. I have added all the relevant files in the folder tools. This needs to put into the folder .conda/env/$project_environment_name$/lib/python3.#/site-packages/pyqchem
]

## Usage

[To run the program the mkl and qchem module needs to be loaded. The run.py script will set up all the relevant folders submitting an initial setup job and the subsequent run.]
